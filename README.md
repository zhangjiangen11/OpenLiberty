# OpenLiberty - GTA 3 in Godot

This project aims to reimplement the GTA 3 on the Godot Engine.

Currently, this project is able to load the game's map, collision data, etc. at
runtime and stream in models and textures as needed.

**This repository doesn't contain GTA3 code or files**

## What It Not Is?

It's not a 1:1 reimplementation because GTA3 is complex and old, the RenderWare formats needs to be converted to Godot which already is a lot of work.

The story mode is also very complex and time consuming to implement.

## How It Works?

The Godot engine loads the GTA3 files at execution by converting them from GTA3 file formats to Godot formats, this conversion is very fast and don't reduce performance.

## Motivation

Currently there's two open-source reimplementations of GTA3:

- [re3](https://github.com/halpz/re3) - It had legal problems due to Rockstar Games code.
- [OpenRW](https://openrw.org/) - Incomplete and not active.

Both projects use the [RenderWare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RenderWare) version of GTA3, which is old and limited for improvements.

Our project is more safe to work because we don't use Rockstar Games code, just the GTA3 files that the user needs to add on the project folder.

Beyond legal safety, the RenderWare version used on the GTA3 is old and technically limited for improvements. While the Godot Engine is modern and much more advanced, also easier to make contributions.

## Probable Future

If we successfully load most GTA3 formats, we could start a GTA San Andreas reimplementation on the Godot engine.

Why? because the GTA San Andreas formats are an evolution of the GTA3 formats, thus part of the GTA3 format converter code can be reused.

Similar to what the [San Andreas Unity](https://github.com/in0finite/SanAndreasUnity) project did, but the Unity engine is closed-source and proprietary.

## Why Godot?

The Godot engine allows you to save a lot of time in development because of the node system, where the relationship between the game components is very easily and fast to implement things.

Also because of GDScript, the Godot scripting language allows you to write less code to implement things.
